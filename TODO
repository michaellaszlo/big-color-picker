Goals:
- explore the relationships among RGB, HSL, HSV
- discover new colors
  - broaden one's perspective with new color bands
  - generate colors randomly
- select colors precisely
- manage palettes
  - store color alternatives in a group
  - automatically generate model layouts from palettes

next steps
+ improve layout
  + move grid to top row
  + enlarge rings to match grid
+ improve grid
  + add colored axes
  + mark grid 
  + clickable grid
  + draggable grid
+ make everything unselectable
- improve drawing performance
  - paint off-screen?
  - make pixel grid in memory?
  - reduce sampling rate while dragging?
- improve ring
  + draggable sector
  - extend sector outside band using hole color
  - micro-adjust buttons near sector

layout
- calculate automatically based on canvas dimensions
  - set holeRadius once
- size canvas to screen

color rings
+ 256 notches around the perimeter

other mixing methods
+ show a mixing band around each basic ring
  + update all bands

  - smooth outside
  - show sector in band
+ click to fix one color and show grid of the two others
- figure out what else would be useful
  - HSV? HSL? other color models?
  - complementary colors?

mixed color
- show the mixed color
- make new ball
- animate new ball

palette management
- rearrange colors
- group alternatives around a color
