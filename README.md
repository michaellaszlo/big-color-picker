# Color Spinner

This is a color picker for the web. It works sort of like a turntable.

The main interface consists of three discs that stand for the colors red, green, and blue. Move the sliders around each disc to change how much of the disc color gets mixed into the overall color.

The amount of each basic color varies from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 255, which amounts to 256 possible values per color. The overall color can be represented by a set of three numbers, like this:

  rgb(255, 0, 127)

An alternative representation which is often seen in HTML styling uses hexadecimal numbers to say the same thing. Instead of three decimal numbers separated by commas, you'll see three hexadecimal numbers of two digits each, all crammed together like this:

  #ff007f

Color Spinner displays both representations.
