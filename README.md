# big-color-picker
This color picker presents three discs on a web page. The discs stand for the basic colors: red, green, and blue. Move the sliders around the edge of each disc to change how much gets mixed into the overall color.

The amount of each basic color varies from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 255. That makes a total of 256 levels per basic color. The overall color can be represented by a set of three numbers, like this:

  rgb(255, 0, 127)

An alternate representation uses hexadecimal numbers. The color picker displays both representations.
